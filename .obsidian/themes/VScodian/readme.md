## Overview

VSCodian brings the familiar look and feel of Visual Studio Code into Obsidian,  
combining the productivity of your favorite editor with the note-taking power of Obsidian.

### Features

- **VS Code-inspired color palette** for both Light and Dark modes.
- **Monospaced headings** for a developer-friendly look.
- **Active tab underline** just like VS Code‚Äôs tab bar.
- **VS Code-style status bar** spanning the entire bottom edge.
- Folder/file tree and icon tweaks to resemble the VS Code explorer.

  and set the RGB values to:  
  - **R:** 0  
  - **G:** 122  
  - **B:** 204
- The theme is designed for Obsidian‚Äôs built-in theme installer (‚ÄúCommunity Themes‚Äù) ‚Äî  
  no manual installation instructions are provided here.
- Works best with the default Obsidian UI layout.  
  Some heavily customized plugin layouts may need additional CSS adjustments.

### Customization

You can easily tweak:

- **Accent color:** Edit the `--interactive-accent` variable in the theme CSS.
- **Heading font:** Change the `--vsc-heading-font` variable to any monospaced font you like.
- **Explorer icons:** Modify the folder/file icon rules in the CSS to match your taste.
